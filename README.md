<h1>Wellcome to VS Launcher</h1>
<p>VS Launcher is the unoficial launcher for Vintage Story.</p>
<p>With this launcher you can easily install multiple version of Vintage Story, create multiple installations with diferent configs, mods, worlds, etc... with just a few clicks!</p>
<p>Currently working on both Windows and Linux but I'll try to make it work on MacOS too, it should work, but I can't test it.</p>
