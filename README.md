# VS Launcher

Wellcome everyone to VS Launcher! Let me present you this project and app.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You NEED to buy a game account to play!

### What is this?

Very simple, a Minecraft-like launcher for Vintage Story.

Here you'll be able to install, manage and play multiple versions of Vintage Story the easy way.

Forget about manually downloading Vintage Story, installing it on different folders, editing the shortcut to add --dataPath... oh and if you wanted to play with mods? What a shame, manually donwload one by one and placing them on the mods folder... too tedious.

With VS Launcher you just have to press a button, select the versions you want to play, give it a name and that's it... press play and you're ready to inmerse yourself in a looong session of gaming.

If you want to add mods is as easy as selecting the installation you want to install them on, search them on the mods tab and press install on the version you want to download. That's it... VS Launcher will download it and place it on the correct forder just for you!

You can have different versions of the game, multiple installations of the same version with different mods and settings... it's pure magic.

### Why i made this?

Well, I've been playing Vintage Story for a loooooong time and I had to create multiple installations to have different mods for different servers or just to test my own mods for development...

As I said before, it was a pain having to do everything manually so I decided to spend hundreds of hours making this launcher to save myself a few hours of manually doing everything... wait... I think I lost more time making this app... whatever... for you, with love, by XurxoMF.

### How it works?

Easy, when you download a new version VS Launcher will download a zip with the game files from my own server and decompress it in the folder of your choice.

Then you can create a new installation and select any of the installed versions to use. This will create a folder wherever you choose to save the installation data like mods, configs, worlds...

Now you only have to select the version you and press play. This will launch the selected version of the game with the selected intallation folder for you to enjoy.

Downloading mods it's the same thing, you can select the intallation you want and download them automatically on that installation mods folder.

Why downloading it from my server and not Vintage Story official servers? Easy, there is no .zip file for download on the official website and with .exe files it's harder for you as a player as you'll have to do everything by yourself and for me as a dev as I'll have to make sure that everything is well installed.

All this .zip files are 100% safe, just in case you don't trust. I donwloaded every single version of the game avilable on the official Vintage Story website, installed it and compressed the files.

I'll try to contact Anego Studios on the near future to ask if they can do this by themseves but I wanted to realease the app asap as I may have less time in the future. If they create an oficial API for game versions and changelogs and give access to .zip files I'll change it to use those instead.
