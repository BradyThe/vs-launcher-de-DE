              This one and the features.installations.installationFolder are
              just placeholders. On the Add version and Add installation pages
              you have a field to choose the folder to use for that
              installation/version. If you empty the path input it'll show this
              as preview.

              It's the new top-minimenu-issues. Now it's just one word. This key
              may be user in other palces too if needed.
