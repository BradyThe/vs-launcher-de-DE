## Planned for the future

* [ ] **Mod manager page**\
  A page to install and manage the mods of your installations.
* [ ] **Auto new game version importer**\
  When a new version of the game is launched I've to manually install it, compress the files and upload them to the VS Launcher API for you to download. I want to make this automatic. Less work for me and you don't have to wait hours for me to upload it.
* [ ] **Server support**\
  A way to install and manage servers! Just install a new server on the version you want, install the mods you need and press start!
* [ ] **Modpack suport**\
  A way to export your installed mods and send them to your friends as `.json` probably so they can import them on the installation they want and all the mods will be automatically installed.
* [ ] **Game configs importer**\
  A way to import the config from one installation to another so you don't have manually change the graphics, audio, keyboard... settings again.
* [ ] **Welcome guide**\
  A little step by step guide for new people. Little popups teaching you how to use the launcher the first time you open it.
