### What the install button colors mean?

To make it easy for you to find the version you need I made the install/update button change it's color depending on compatibility. This is what each color means:

<table><thead><tr><th width="85"></th><th width="478">What it means</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f7e9">ðŸŸ©</span></td><td>100% compatible. If the author added the version AND patch from your Installation on the compatible game versions of the mod version.</td><td><p>Mod 1.20.4</p><p>Installation 1.20.4</p></td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f7e8">ðŸŸ¨</span></td><td>Should be compatible. If the author added the version from your Installation on the compatible game versions of the mod version.</td><td><p>Mod 1.20.X</p><p>Installation 1.20.4</p></td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f7e5">ðŸŸ¥</span></td><td>Not compatible. If the author didn't added the version from your Installation on the compatible game versions of the mod version.</td><td><p>Mod 1.19.X</p><p>Installation 1.20.X</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
