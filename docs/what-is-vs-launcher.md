# ‚ùì What is VS Launcher?

With this app you can easily install Vintage Story versions, create multiple installations with different mods, configs, worlds...., make automatic backups to prevent world corruptions and many other things.

Currently working on both Windows and Linux but I'll port it to MacOS soon!

{% hint style="warning" %}
VS Launcher uses the official game files so you need an official account to play!
